I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",0,

I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking.

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",1,

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",0,

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",0,

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",0,

I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",0,

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",1,

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",1,

I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs.

I have some specific requests/needs for the next OTR job I accept. I'm planning to spend the next 24-36 months running over the road, I would like to work for a person or company that would allow me to train my wife, she is about to attend truck driving school. I am not a job hopper, I have only worked for a handful of companies, am dependable, never failed a drug test, been late, or had any kind of accident. I want to also work on a 1099, I do not need benefits other than good dependable equipment to drive. I do prefer an auto, but this isn't a deal-breaker .Full disclosure, aside from driving for a person or company that pays me when they should and keeps their word, what is important to me at this point is making as much money as possible over the next couple of years. I live in West Tennessee but can come to any place in the country to pick up a truck and start work.I would consider lease/rent positions under the right circumstances, one of which would include a walk away clause. I am not your typical truck driver, I have a Master's degree and working towards a Ph.D., which I hope to complete over the next couple of years. I plan to leave trucking completely to teach, hence the 2-3 year limit of which I hope to bank a significant amount of money before I leave trucking. Below I will summarize my needs, wants, and requirements.OTR- 1099 driving position (min 2500 a week-solo)Prefer someone who will allow me to train my wife so we can run teamsI have 2 dogs 3lbs and 6 lbsI'm located in West Tennessee between Memphis and Nashville 25 miles north of I40Prefer a truck that is automatic, but not a deal-breakerThe truck doesn't matter other than needs a fridge and inverterIf these options sound like something that you can work with please contact me by email, do not contact me with anything other than trucking jobs. Also, don't just email me and tell me to call you, set yourself apart from the other emails, give me some info on what you can do for me and why I should work for you or your company.Thanks,Tim",0,
