3402,471,"Hi! My name is Alexyss Rubjerg and I am a social media marketer! I graduated with a business degree which really jump-started my drive. However, my childhood dream was always to own multiple businesses so I guess I should credit that. I absolutely love working with other entrepreneurs. I figured since I was able to build my dream I should help others build theirs. I devise a strategy through intense research for each and every business I work with. There is not a one size fits all social media strategy and understanding that is key, but I can help you find the one that works for your business. Creating content and captions is a main part of what I do but engagement is by far the most important part of how I help clients. Engagement helps your followers get a more personal view of you and helps them feel connected, thus bringing back more business regardless of if you are a service provider or sell products. Engagement is also one of the hardest things for business owners to do since it can take up so much time. That is why I am here to help! If you are struggling with social media for your business, or even if you aren't and you just want to outsource it then visit my website and schedule a consultation! During that consult we will go over your difficulties and your goals so that I can craft a strategy unique to you! alexyssrubjerg.com",6,31,"✨NEED HOUSE CLEANERS TO START THIS WEEK ✨$27+/hr, Paid Weekly             (google map)        compensation: up to $1500 per weekemployment type: contractrelocation assistance availableQR Code Link to This PostCLICK HERE TO APPLY IN 60 SECONDSHi, we're a local housecleaning company and we are getting a rush of clients and need cleaners to start now!If you have cleaning experience, we'd love to work with you.

5086,445,"I am looking for part-time work ONLY. Email only, if you'd like a phone call please provide your number in your reply.Hello! If you'd like to see my full resume, please respond to this ad. I'm looking for anything a little different, especially if it'll teach me new skills, so I figured the best way to avoid run-of-the-mill stuff would be to have a sort of informal ad. Thanks! I'm currently a full time artist, doing strange and silly illustrations and selling strange and silly clothes, but honestly I'm getting a little bored/lonely! I work from home, although I would even if there wasn't a pandemic, and I have zero coworkers. I've been doing this kind of work for about a decade, but only for a little over a year have I been doing it as my sole income after leaving a job because of a poorly managed covid outbreak. I love my art job dearly and all of the people I do work for, it will always come first before any other gig I may take, but frankly I'd like some variety. I have hefty experience with self managing, direct client communication, social media (I currently have 10.6k Twitter followers) and illustration. I do not do graphic design, and only know a little about it, but would love to learn. From my past jobs I also have a lot of experience with phone calls, scheduling appointments, problem solving, being general support for other staff, errand running, food prep, nannying (kids age 5-10), and a little bit of retail. I also have dabbled in several other artforms, including ceramics and sculpture. I'm looking for something interesting, engaging, and involved. I'd love to get to know whoever I'm working for and my coworkers! I miss working directly with other people to get jobs done and am still very close with several people I've worked with at my previous job. Basically, I want to feel involved in at least some sort of in-person community again. I'd be volunteering at the Field Museum, but they aren't taking volunteers again yet because of covid. A little bit about myself, I'm very interested in art and illustration (of course), but my other main passions include being outdoors, animals/zoology, and writing. I also skateboard a little and love biking! Anything that gets me out and around and learning is exciting for me, and I love picking up new skills and knowledge. If you'd like to see my resume and references, please let me know, I'm happy to send them. I'd also be happy to show you my Instagram if you'd like to see my work! At the moment most of my projects are small, but in the near future I plan on illustrating a short comic that may take up a lot of my time. If you are able to give me flexible hours that would be amazing!Thanks for you time, please don't hesitate to ask any questions.
